# AI for Tic-Tac-Toe
# The traditional board game Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is #played by two players, designated by the letters X and O, who alternately mark the squares on a #3 by 3 grid. Whoever successfully arranges three of their markers in a row—horizontal, vertical, #or diagonal—is the winner.

I've used the minimax algorithm in this code to direct the computer's next step and let it crack the challenge.This programme combines the minimax approach with alpha-beta pruning.
